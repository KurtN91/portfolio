title: The Cannonball Versus Dipping Your Toe
---


It has always surprised me when a programmer says that they have stopped learning after they got their degree. They argue that they have all the skills necessary to remain in their job without issue, so why bother learning something new? "Look at COBOL!", they say, "Those people can just stick with that their entire lives and always be employed!"

I guess I do not have a great counter-argument to that statement, as businesses are willing to shell out quite a bit of cash to find someone with COBOL skills nowadays. But to me, it sounds like a dreadfully boring way to experience your career. One of the things that drew me to programming was the sheer scale of knowledge that was mine for the taking. Books upon books, website after website, all of it dedicated to something new or fascinating coming in the field. It is rare to find something that evolves as quickly as coding does. New techniques are always coming out, ready to be mastered by those who have the drive to do so.

Learning should be a lifelong goal in this profession, not just for the benefits of being on the cutting edge. We have a near unique chance to constantly better ourselves and our minds while working, and believe me, we should take advantage of it. Before I worked with computers, I worked in a restaurant and in a packaging plant. Both jobs bored me to tears, and left me unsatisfied at the end of the day in every way possible. I spent most of my time working in those places trying to design machines that would do my work for me while I found a quiet corner to curl up and sleep in. Only once I got into coding did my mind feel challenged and focused. And what a joy that feeling is.
