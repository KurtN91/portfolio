title: A Developing Story
---


My history of a developer involves many, many branches, most of them quite short. And I wouldn't have it any other way.

In my scant years as a programmer, I explored Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, C++, C#, Ruby (and Rails), and a bit of Python all before I had a non-contract job. While it may sound like I'm suffering from ADHD, I'd like to advise others to consider doing something similar. 

Learning many languages, even just the basics, allows you to see a bigger picture of programming, and the versatility you gain can never be underestimated. But the best reason to shop around, so to speak, is one you might overlook. It lets you find out what you like and don't like in coding. 

For me, I learned quickly that I would never be a SQL developer or a data scientist. Both involve manipulating what is already there, where what I find most enjoyable about programming is the idea of making something completely new. With that in mind, I found that I really enjoyed mobile development, seeing as I was making products that people could conceivably use every day. Pulling on my Java knowledge, I was able to dive into Android development with little delay. It was much faster than if I would have had to learn object-oriented programming from scratch. In my opinion, a broad base allows you to build your skills faster and easier than becoming entrenched in one area before you're even sure if you'll like it.
