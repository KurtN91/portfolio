title: The Future With AI
---

Thinking about how AI will change our lives in the near future sparks an interesting debate: How much should we automate? As a programmer, I'm expected to say, "Everything!". However, I think that over-automation could lead to a couple negative outcomes.

We've already seen how our current level of machine production has reduced the job market. More machines means less people needed, leading to rising unemployment. That can only lead to more issues in the long run; idle hands are the devil's workshop after all. In addition, we might see a massive influx of programmers when other career options become endangered by the encroaching mechanical laborers. I'm not saying that competition in the job market is a bad thing, but studies have already shown that many people applying for programming positions aren't even coders. They're just applying to every job they can. Imagine laxer qualifications for programming positions. We'd be flooded with nonfunctional or, at the least, low quality code that would slow everything down. 

As programmers, I think our mission needs to be to enhance other people at their jobs, not just replace the people outright. Certainly, a well made machine might be better at a job than the person currently working it. But that machine will not be able to come up with creative solutions like a worker can. There's a place for each of us in the world, a chance for all of us to work hard and contribute to a better future.
